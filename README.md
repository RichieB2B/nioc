# No Indicators of Compromise

Working with Cyber Threat Intelligence for detecting security threats
requires being able to separate real threats from the fake ones. Chasing
false positives wastes time. Unfortunately even commercial CTI feeds are
littered with bad quality Indicators of Compromise (IoC\'s). This repository
consists of data that are guaranteed to pose no threat at all. They all all
bona fide No Indicators of Compromise.

If you encounter an false positive IoC\'s anywhere please add it to this
repository and make a pull request.
